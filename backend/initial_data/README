Render – API hosting for web services.
Vercel – Deployed the frontend.
Please note that Render may restart due to file changes, so I ignored those files to prevent the server from restarting, which could cause CORS errors.



Tips:

npm init -y
npm i express cors
npm install nodemon
node --env-file=.env app.js
