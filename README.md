# Shared-Workspace-Web-App
Coworking lets individuals or teams share a workspace. If you're self-employed or work from home, you may want to rent a desk or meeting room with office essentials. As coworking grows, we aim to build an app connecting users with shared spaces, similar to how Uber links riders to drivers and Airbnb connects tenants to landlords.
